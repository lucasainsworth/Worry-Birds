# Worry-Birds

Worry Birds are fold-up mechanical birds you can make or change as you like. The paper pattern uses 8.5 x 11" cardstock and printer paper. You'll also need four hobby-servos, (I use HiTec 311's,) some hobby-store parts and an Intel Galileo development board (or an Arduino Uno for a non-connected version.)
