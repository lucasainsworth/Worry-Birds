Worry Birds are fold-up mechanical birds you can make or change as you like. The paper pattern uses 8.5 x 11" cardstock and printer paper. You'll also need four hobby-servos, (I use [HiTec 311's,](https://www.servocity.com/html/hs-311_standard.html#.VgdP9nilqfY)) some hobby-store parts and an Intel Galileo development board (or an Arduino Uno for a non-connected version.) 

For prototyping, and quick connections, I use a [DF Robot IO expansion shield.](http://www.dfrobot.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1009#.VgdNtHilqfY)  This shield makes it easy to plug servos and sensors right in to the board.

You'll need some servo brackets to mount the servos. Hot glue won't stick well to the side of a servo! Four of [these](http://www.robotshop.com/en/lynxmotion-aluminum-multi-purpose-servo.html)  (very useful for othe projects too!) and one of [these](http://www.robotshop.com/en/aluminum-l-connector-bracket-asb-06.html)

Hobby store parts! Hobby stores are a great source of little hinges and mechanical things!
I used these [dubro hinges.](http://shop.dubro.com/p/nylon-hinge-standard-size-qty-pkg-6?pp=12)

To make the servos move the wings and the head, you'll need three [RC pushrods](http://shop.dubro.com/p/kwik-link-on-a-12-2-56-rod?pp=12) and three [control horns.](http://shop.dubro.com/p/1-2-a-control-horns-qty-pkg-2?pp=12)

Here is the paper pattern!  [(Download Link)](http://www.pdf-archive.com/2015/09/27/bird-pattern/)

I need to post more photos and step-by-step guide.  More to come!
